# Answer Key

## 1) Fundamental types
The main categories covered were:
- **Boolean**: `bool`
- **Integer types**: `short`, `int`, `long`, `long long`, and unsigned versions
- **Floating point**: `float`, `double`, `long double`
- **Character types**: `char`, `char8_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`, `wchar_t`
- **Void**: `void`

## 2) `sizeof` and platform dependence
The notes described these as platform dependent:
- `long` can be 4 or 8 bytes
- `wchar_t` can be 2 or 4 bytes
- `long double` can be 10 or 16 bytes

This matters because code that assumes exact sizes can break across systems. If size matters, prefer fixed-width types like `int32_t`.

## 3) Fixed-width integers
- `int`: normal general-purpose integer type; size is implementation-dependent, though often 4 bytes
- `int32_t`: exactly 32 bits
- `int_fast32_t`: at least 32 bits, but chosen to be fast on that platform

Use:
- `int` for everyday arithmetic
- `int32_t` when exact size matters, like file formats, protocols, serialization, hardware work
- `int_fast32_t` when you want at least 32 bits and care about performance portability

## 4) Initialization styles
```cpp
int b = 5;   // copy initialization
int c(5);    // direct initialization
int d{5};    // brace/list initialization
int e = {5}; // copy-list initialization
```
Preferred style: **brace initialization `{}`**

Why:
- prevents narrowing conversions
- works consistently across types
- is safer and more uniform

## 5) Narrowing conversions
Narrowing means converting a value to a type that cannot represent it exactly without losing information.

```cpp
int z1 = 3.9;
```
Allowed, but lossy. `z1` becomes `3`.

```cpp
int z2{3.9};
```
Not allowed. Brace initialization rejects narrowing.

## 6) Endianness
For `0x12345678`:
- **Little-endian**: `78 56 34 12`
- **Big-endian**: `12 34 56 78`

Little-endian means the **least significant byte is stored first** at the lowest memory address.

## 7) Literals
- `42` → decimal integer literal, usually `int`
- `42u` → unsigned integer literal
- `42LL` → `long long` literal
- `3.14f` → `float` literal
- `3.14L` → `long double` literal
- `0x2A` → hexadecimal integer literal
- `0b00101010` → binary integer literal
- `'\n'` → newline character literal
- `nullptr` → null pointer literal
- `R"(Hello\nWorld)"` → raw string literal, where `\n` is treated as the characters backslash and `n`, not as an escaped newline

## 8) `const` vs `constexpr`
- `const`: value cannot be changed after initialization, but it may be initialized at runtime
- `constexpr`: value must be known at compile time

Example where `const` is valid but `constexpr` is not:

```cpp
int runtime_val = 7;
const int a = runtime_val;      // OK
// constexpr int b = runtime_val; // ERROR
```

## 9) Pointer constness
```cpp
const int* p1;
```
`p1` is a pointer to const int.
- can change where `p1` points
- cannot modify the pointee through `p1`

```cpp
int* const p2 = nullptr;
```
`p2` is a const pointer to int.
- cannot change where `p2` points after initialization
- can modify the pointee through `p2` if it points to valid non-const int

```cpp
const int* const p3 = nullptr;
```
`p3` is a const pointer to const int.
- cannot change pointer
- cannot modify pointee through it

## 10) Unsigned behavior
```cpp
unsigned int u = 0;
u -= 1;
```
This wraps around to the maximum value representable by `unsigned int`, such as `4294967295` on a 32-bit unsigned type.

This is **defined behavior**, not UB. Unsigned arithmetic wraps modulo the range size.

## 11) `auto` deduction
```cpp
auto x = 42;      // int
auto y = 3.14;    // double
auto z = 3.14f;   // float
const int ci = 42;
auto a1 = ci;     // int
auto& a2 = ci;    // const int&
const auto a3 = ci; // const int
```

“Drops const and references by default” means plain `auto` deduces a non-reference type and usually strips top-level `const`.

So with:
```cpp
const int ci = 42;
auto a1 = ci;
```
`a1` becomes plain `int`, not `const int`.

## 12) Stack vs heap
**Stack**
- very fast allocation/deallocation
- automatic lifetime management
- used for local variables and function call frames
- limited size; objects die automatically at scope end

**Heap**
- slower allocation
- manual management, or managed through smart pointers
- used for dynamic lifetime / objects that outlive a scope / flexible sizing
- risk of leaks, dangling pointers, double frees

Code:
```cpp
int* p = new int(42);
delete p;
p = nullptr;
```
- `new int(42)` allocates an `int` on the heap and initializes it to `42`
- `p` itself is a stack variable that stores the address
- `delete p` frees the heap memory
- `p = nullptr` avoids leaving a dangling pointer value behind

## 13) Type conversions
```cpp
long l = 42;
```
`int` to `long`; widening conversion; generally safe

```cpp
double d = 42;
```
`int` to `double`; widening conversion; generally safe

```cpp
int n = 3.14;
```
`double` to `int`; lossy conversion; decimal part is discarded

```cpp
int m = static_cast<int>(3.14);
```
Still lossy, but explicit and clearer than relying on implicit conversion

```cpp
char* bytes = reinterpret_cast<char*>(&n);
```
Low-level reinterpretation of the object’s bytes; potentially useful for byte-level inspection, but dangerous and not for normal safe conversions

## 14) Scope and lifetime
- Inside the inner block, `local = 99` shadows the outer `local = 5`, so the inner one is used there
- `inner` is destroyed when the inner block ends, at its closing `}`
- `counter()` prints increasing values because `count` is `static`, so it is initialized only once and keeps its value across function calls

## 15) References and structured bindings
1. A reference is an alias for an existing object.
2. A reference differs from a pointer because it must be initialized, cannot be rebound, and conceptually behaves like another name for the same object. A pointer can be null and can point somewhere else later.
3. In this code:

```cpp
int x = 42;
int& ref = x;
int y = 99;
ref = y;
```

`ref` still refers to `x`. The statement `ref = y;` assigns the value of `y` into `x`. It does **not** rebind the reference. Afterward, `x` becomes `99`.

4. Structured bindings unpack an object into named variables. Here:

```cpp
std::pair<int, double> p = {42, 3.14};
auto [integer, decimal] = p;
```

`integer` gets `42` and `decimal` gets `3.14`.
